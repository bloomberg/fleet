## What is this repository?

This repository is a fork of Kolide's Fleet repository, created so that Bloomberg's
engineering team can collaborate with each other (and the rest of the Fleet community)
on enhancements to Fleet. Branches in this repository represent 'work in progress' that
will be contributed to the Kolide Fleet repository when the work is ready for review.

If you have any questions about the branches in this repository, feel free to open an issue
so our team can discuss them with you.
